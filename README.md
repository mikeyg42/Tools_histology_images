# Image Processing Tools for Whole Slide Imaging Brightfield Histology

Hi, welcome to the beginning of my depositing of nearly a decade of code I've accumulated through working in academic research labs as a student, and for the past 6+ years as a technician/research coordinator. Although I have, at varuious times, worked on projects as disparate as studying syntax of bird song and gestational diabetes in mice, the thing most constant over the past 6 years has been the histology work I've done. While staining of tissue never takes more than a week or two (for a large cohort), the microscopy, data extraction, and statistical analyses have conusmed more of my life then I care to admit. Recognizing how many issues are solved by implementing as much of this downstream workflow in software automating each step, I have devoted considerable time to researching, writing, and compiling code to facilitate this work. Now that I have a bit of time as a result of my recent unemployment, I've decided to clean/polish/upload online some of this abounding code, beginning with the most likely tools many other might find helpful.

In particular, I think the first set of tools I'll share are all MATLAB code I wrote once I started working a lot of huge, tiled, image mosaics, which are often referred to as "whole-slide images". Whole-slide images are "all the rage" right now, for a few reasons. New models of scanners are on the market now that do a good job at a low price. The medical imaging literature is replete with WSI articles, in part because it is something new and the field is quite saturated. Also, it only recently has it become commonplace for researchers to have sufficient computing power/storage to permit processing of these large files. And then finally, there is growing awareness of the necessary rigor these sorts of statistical analyses require to produce reproducible, meaningful data - for many imaging experiments, the traditional theory of engourging one's statistical power by collecting ROI's haphazardly from a stained slide and treating each image as an independent sample is increasingly seen as unacceptable. Two images collected from adjacent ROI's in the same staining of one brain are far from independent, and as such the biologists reflex to average and run a T-Test, is insufficient; by quantifying much larger regions within a tissue, one might loose some power, but by achieving much more representative, noise-free, and independent samples, the applicability of techniques such as bootstrapping become more justifiable. Finally, as cell biology becomes increasingly concerned with both cellular heterogeneity within a tissue bed, as well as the dynamic microforces governing cellular organization and behvaior within a tissue, WSI imaging facilitates the keeping sight of the proverbial forest through the trees, bridging the divide between microscopic and the mesoscopic. Regardless, I have grown quite fond of this approach and developed a number of MATLAB scripts specifically designed to handle such images.

What do I mean when I say they are specifically designed to handle such images? For 1, as previously suggested, these images are huge. My iamges range in their raw, tiff, 12-byte format, generally are at minimum a billion pixels, and theri filesize ranges from around 1GB for a small tissue to north of 7GB. In the context of the confocal, they might become substantially larger. The images are collected as individual tiles (for the most part I used a 10x objective, at 1080 x 1364 dimensions, a resolution of 0.64um/pi, 24-byte color storage, 10% overlap of tiles, of which there were an minimum 20 x 25, going up to 38 x 48 tiles for larger tissue pieces. .,,,,, 

I'll finish you later.

I've started off with two general tools. The first, and most thoroughly tested/annotated is a library of tools for the image processing of whole slide images.
