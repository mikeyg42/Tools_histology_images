% -------... brief discussion about Algebra, OPTIONAL read ....<start discussion> ----------
% topic: why bother with Chebychev nodes? 

% Of Pafnuty Chebyshev's prolific contributions to math (e.g.
% top five most famous inequalities "Chebyshev inequality", his work with prime numbers,  probability...)
% were the so-called Chebyshev polynomials.
% They all exist within [-1, 1], and are orthogonal/
% For "the first kind" of this class of polynomials, the x-coordinates of the roots of the
% n'th polynomial in this series (where T sub-n of (cos(theta)) = cos(n*theta)) elegantly 
% work out to be n equally spaced points along a unit semi-circle . 
% 
% Just imagine placing evenly subdividing the rim of half a circle and 
% then looking at those points' x-coordinates. Near -1 and 1 the points will be tightly
% packed, but on the curve they will be equidistant. 
%       Chebyshev points:
%        _*--^^*^^--*_   
%      */ |    |    | \*  <--- the asterix in theory equally spaced apart (use imagination)
%     *|  |    |    |  |*        
%     oo--o----o----o--oo <--- "diameter" of circle with projected points irregularly spaced apart (nodes = no's)
%     
% Why do this? There is a phenomenon described by a german mathematician named 
% Carl David Tolme Runge in 1901 (Runge's phenomenon) where one's efforts at
% interpolating a high degree polynomial with points equidistant along the x-axis are 
% thwarted on the edges by large, expanding oscillations. Chebyshev nodes end up being one way to guarantee
% this does NOT happen. As a result, they're commonly used for interpolating high degree
% polynomials. 

% to calculate n number of Chebyshev nodes, each point k in range [1:1:n] is:
% x(k) = cos((2k-1)*(pi/2n). I use the nice matlab function cospi((2k-1)/2n)= x for
% each n!

%results in n+1 nodes. Later one, we will remove 1 of the 2 corners from each line so that
%we have one corner per side and nothing is double counted

% 4. fit rotated points to a curve, trying:
%     { 1->3   1st-3rd polynomial of the 1st, 2nd, & 3rd degrees,
