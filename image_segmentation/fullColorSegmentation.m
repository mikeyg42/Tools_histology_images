function [BWmask, BWedge] = fullColorSegmentation(rawRGBim)
% BWmask = colorVectorSegment(RGBim)
% This function segments RGB images with white background. My goal here was to capture
% edges in color that might be missed by calling RGB2GRAY or any similar colorspace
% intensity projection. To start, we begin by seperating the RGB channels, increasing the
% contrasts of each, padding them, and then applying a sliding correlational spatial
% filter: namely, we collect a variant of the typical high pass filter by taking a sliding
% 5x5 neighborhood and calculatig for each pixel the deltaE magnitude of difference of
% each tristumulus from the average of the 24 pixels around it. We then take the
% derivative of this deltaE image, using Peter Kovesi's funciton for the 7-tap estimate of
% image partial derivaties. We apply local contrasting via IMLOCALBRIGHTEN to the magnitude of the
% second derivattive gradient.

% After this, we use image reconstruction to enhance our 1st derivative image with the
% enhanced edges of the second derivative. After this, using the morphological function
% IMIMNPOSEMIN applied to this enhanced image achieves an image very amenable to
% segmentation!
