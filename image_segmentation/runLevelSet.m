function outOfBoundsMask = runLevelSet(rgbImage)
% This function implements a very simply formualtion of the level sets
% algorithm. syntax is: outOfBoundsMask = runLevelSet(rgbImage)
% -=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=
% INPUT: an RGB Image, after preprocessing to correct for background ect.

% PROCESSING:
%  - image is significantly downsampled.
%  - Using gradients we extract a solid, boundary edge, which acts as a scalar
%    force field (when the expanding interface encounters white, it expands,
%    and when it encounters black it retreats).
%        - This is facilitated by some substantial pre-prcessing blurring).
%  - I initialize the zero-level set as a circle centered on the weighted centroid,
%    with a radius 1/6 the shorter side of the bounding box.
%  - The algorithm is allowed to cycle for 1250 iterations, which should be
%     overkill except instances with objects with long thin protrusions.
%  - For the sake of processing time, I opted against including a "reset"
%    as is recommended by the text of the reference text (see below). The reset would 
%    ensure the level-set function stays a sign-distance fuction throughout
%    iterations. But in testing my im's, segmentation worked without it well enough.
%  - I've written a script to fill in any gaps left by the crude
%    thresholding approach I use to binarize the result, which I call in
%    the try/catch - it "catches" when there are no gaps to be filled.
%  - After the level set algorithm completes, its obvious upon inspection that,
%    as a result of the blurring, we sometimes do initially to get a strong
%    boundary and as a result, our segmentation is not precisely lined-up with input
%    im. I correct this with a few iterations of a snake contour.
%  - Finally, i resize this mask back to the size of the input. 

% OUTPUT: a logical image of the same size as input, with
%       0 = background & 1 = foreground

%   NOTE: Sometimes this algorithm doesn't work... In that event, 
%   it will output a black rectangle with a white circle, which 
%   should prevent the whole Segementation GUI script to fail.
