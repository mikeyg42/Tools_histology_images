% outputMask = vectorCalcSegment(inputImageRGB)
%
% This is a segmentation function. It leerages 4 different discrete methods for numeric
% approximations of image derivatives or various orders. Using the contrast-enhanced luminosity
% image, we find approximations of the 0.6th, 1st, 2nd, and 2.6th order graidents. 
% We convert each of these into binary masks, and then we average them togerther before 
% thresholding the resulting composite image. After filling in this blob we have our final output 
% BW MASK!
%
% In a 5000x5000x3 image generating the mask takes 30-45 seconds. 
% 
% - Firstly, the most straightforward, technique is using
% the built-in function imgradientxy to generate the first order partial derivatives.
% We can use these partial derivates (1 in regards to x and the other y) and calculate
% from them the overall 1st order gradient magnitude, using hypot (which handles overflow
% well).

% - Second, we use a perhaps more accurate estimation of the image gradient 1st and 2nd
% order, using an implementation written by Peter Kovesi of the 7-tap approximation of the
% derivative. We combine the images produced by this approximation in order to generate
% the fsecond derivative in the gradient direction (SDGD) image, which is well known for
% strongely accentuating edeges. I take this oine step further and use image
% reconstruction with the local variance in order to emphasize not just any edges, but in
% particular edges with higher amounts of local variance, indicative of "real" edges. 

% - Thirdly, I have calculated two fractional derivatives using the numerical method of 
% Riemann and Liouville which was improved upon by the Caputo-Gr√ºmwald formula.Fractional
% Derivates often have advantageous edges and less halo-effects. They also offer us
% diversity by accentuarting different edges than integer derivaties might. I've here
% found that 0.6th order and the 2.6th order achieves great results with my images,
% choices made based on trial and error of values close by to x.5, which I figured would
% offer the most given we already have 1st and 2nd derivative approximations. 

% Because the derivative images are invariably noisey, care had toi be taken to apply 
% edge-preserving blurring techniques alongside contrast enhancement. It may be that in 
% a different dataset these filter sizes and intensities might need to be shuffled around.  
% NOTE: I tried to as much as possible avoid using any morphological dilation/erosion, so
% to keep the mask as sharp and precise as possible. I have permitted just one, for the
% SDGD processing.
